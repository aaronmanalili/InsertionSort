# InsertionSort

Assignment 1 from my Data Structures and Algorithms class. Submitted on February 17, 2021

Instructions. You are provided the skeleton code named Sort.java. The source
file is available on Canvas in a folder named HW1. Please modify the skeleton
code to solve the following tasks.

•Task 1 (80 pts). Implement the Insertion Sort algorithm as discussed in
Lecture 1. (Hint: use the function checked sorted to check if your output
is indeed sorted.)

•Task 2 (20 pts). Generate a report to discuss the time performance of
the algorithm. Compare it with their theoretical time complexity as dis-
cussed in the lecture. Plots and figures are encouraged to help draw the
conclusion. See Figure 1 for an example of the plot.
